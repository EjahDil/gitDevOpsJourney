# 🚀 DevOps Training Project: MongoDB + Mongo Express on Docker & Kubernetes

This repository contains **DevOps training materials and hands-on exercises** demonstrating how to containerize and deploy a simple **MongoDB + Mongo Express** application using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.

The goal of this project is to understand **containerization, orchestration, service exposure, and configuration management** in a real-world DevOps workflow.

## Project Overview

The application stack consists of:

- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database
- **Mongo Express** – Web-based MongoDB admin UI
- **Docker** – For containerizing applications
- **Kubernetes** – For orchestrating and managing containers

This project simulates a **real DevOps deployment pipeline** using local Kubernetes (Minikube / Kind) or a cloud Kubernetes cluster.
